### 10 years of engineering data inside big tech
SignalFire Beacon Data is created from the result of over 80 sources of enriched data
- info on billions of profiles, people and companies over the last 14 years
- not based on survey data

### AI Engineer Boom
After 2014, it's been explosive, then steady growth for AI engineering across all industries.

While AI engineering has grown, engineering retention is going down, while team size is going up.

### Unemployment
From a Pragmatic Engineer survey, the unemployment rate for engineers is higher than the general unemployment rate currently. Reduction in college grads getting hired.

Roughly 1 in 10 engineers is hired with a non-traditional background.

### Advice for Companies to Lead
There is a strong correlation between open source and retaining top talent.
