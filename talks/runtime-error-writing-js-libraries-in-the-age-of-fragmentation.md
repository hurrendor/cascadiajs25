## Abstract: 

Building for the web used to mean fighting browser quirks. Now, it's runtime quirks. Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Edge runtimes, React Native, they all run JavaScript, sort of. Each comes with its own gotchas.

Throw in ESM vs CJS, native TypeScript vs compiled JS, export maps, bundlers, and half-supported compatibility layers, and you’ve got a new kind of chaos.

In this talk, I’ll share the challenges we faced building the OpenAI Agents SDK and how we navigated the messy modern JS landscape.
