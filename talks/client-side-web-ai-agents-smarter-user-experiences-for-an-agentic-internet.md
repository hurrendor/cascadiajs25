## Abstract: 

Learn how to create and run client side AI agents in JS, powered by smaller LLMs, to perform useful work faster on existing websites using Web AI. Get a glimpse of the future - an agentic internet.
# Community talk notes: 

## Why Client Side AI?
- Privacy
Keeping personal data off the cloud. IE, video check-ins for physical therapy.
- Work Offline
xample: Retail analytics through [Consumer Goods Detection](https://goo.gle/WebAI-Goods)
- Latency
- Cost
- Zero install
Usage is not blocked by company policies
- Reach & Scale of the Web

### [WebML highlights (video)](https://goo.gle/made-with-tfjs)
- Animatronics
- Roboflow pill count detection
- Hand detection in video feed to allow whiteboard sketches
- Physical therapy for clinician review

## What's an Agent?
A system that performs tasks autonomously for a user.
Dynamically select and use tools in a loop to go beyond the constrains of the core language.
Ex: Asking about the weather with an LLM calling the Weather API to verify the weather status.

## Language Models
One or more LLMs (potentialy multimodal) capabale of following instruction based reasoning
Steps used in agentic :
- planning
- tool usage
- memory

## Takeaway: Use your existing website functions as tools to create more natural user interfaces
Hybrid Web AI is a great starting point today
