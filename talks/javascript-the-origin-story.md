## Abstract: 

JavaScript wasn't always the cool kid on the block. In this talk, we'll follow how a lil 10-day hackathon became the cornerstone of modern web dev.
## Community talk notes: 

## The Beginning
### Let's start in the 90's!
Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, we've got HTML, web browsers, URLs and HTTP!

### 1994 - Beginning of Netscape Navigator
Microsoft took note and brought out Internet Explorer

Brandon Ike - built out JavaScript for Netscape
First - Mocha, then LiveScape, then JavaScript!

### 1996 - Internet Explorer 3.0 with support for 'JScript'
Developers needed to develop separately for Netscape and IE
Thus starts the 'Browser Wars'

### 1997 - JavaScript was brought into EcmaScript
### 1998 - DOM Level Specification Standards
### 2005 - DOM Support through AJAX
With jQuery, the rise of SPAs (Single page applications) began.
### 2008 - Google's V8 Engine
Provided just-in-time compilation to allow JS to compile to machine code at run time.
Ryan Dahl - created Node.js to run JS outside of the browser

### Atwood's law (Jeff Atwood)
> Anything that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

Beginning of perceiving DOM elements as components, task runners, and concatenation.
Module systems like CommonJS led to bundling systems (like browserify)
### 2014 - Webpack
Combining task runners, ES modules, tree shaking, hot module reloading, etc, etc.

### 2015 - Modernization
ES6, TypeScript and a big change in how architecture was approached by developers with serverless functions.
