## Abstract: 

I'm proud of my kids. I didn't do the work—they did. I just prompted them. Same with AI. When it makes something bonkers, I still feel proud. Should I? I do. It's weird. Let’s get used to it. Let’s chat.
## Community talk notes: 

### Are you allowed to be proud of what AI creates for you?
Comparisons to being proud of 'installing' values in children and being proud of their accomplishments and actions. 
So yes, be proud of what you did. It didn't exist before you built it.
### Why are we afraid to admit we use AI?
Afraid of being 'posers'?
### What if we were truthful?
We have to be transparent about using AI. "I made this, and this is how I did it"
