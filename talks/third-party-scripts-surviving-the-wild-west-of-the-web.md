## Abstract: 

As third-party script developers, we constantly work in environments we don't fully control. We must handle unexpected issues introduced by different browsers, quirky customizations made by the primary developer team, and security restrictions we can't easily bypass. In this introductory-level session, I will share first-hand experiences and practical guidance derived from building and deploying third-party scripts to improve your team's confidence and workflow efficiency.
