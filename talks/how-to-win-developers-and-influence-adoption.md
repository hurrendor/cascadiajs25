## Community talk notes: 

### Lessons learned
#### 1. Build trust
Be helpful - answer questions you can help with.
Be kind - this helps others feel comfortable asking questions
#### 2. Deserve attention
Attention is a precious resource, and the best way to get it is not constantly pinging everyone. 
Meet developers and people where they are. Use a hook - something that catches their interest that would solve a problem for them.
#### 3. Remove friction
Two stages where development is most difficult - getting started, and keeping it implemented.
Utilize documentation as a feature - define the steps for your solution and how/where to get started.
