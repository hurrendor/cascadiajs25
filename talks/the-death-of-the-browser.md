## Abstract: 

What is the Web without a browser? Through Chrome, Google has been supporting and stewarding the growth of the web as an ads-supported economy. Now, AI Agents and MCP threaten to change everything. Some might say the Web is about to die, but maybe it is about to be reborn like a phoenix. 
## Community talk notes: 

People are turning to AI for answers instead of searches. Why? Enshittification.

## Enshittification steps:
1. The platform is good to their users. Acquire users by directing profits to them until they're locked in.
2. The platform abuses their users for their business users. Attract suppliers by directing profits to them until they're locked in.
3. The platform abuses their business users for their own value and fail. Once both users and suppliers are locked in, direct profits to shareholders.


## 3 types of traffic on the web
- Human 
  - Reads and perceives content, including ads
- Crawler
  - indexes and scrapes content
- Agent
  - Performs tasks on behalf of humans

## Will we even need a browser?
Time has shiftend to spend more time on mobile apps vs browser.
Agents can provide the ultimate app experience.

## The Web *is* the API, the *Agent* is the Client

## The 5 pillars of the agentic web
1. Agent interoperability - MCP, ACP, A2A, ANP, + more
   - Function calling (aka Tool Use)
   - Feature in LLMs that enables them to connect to external tools and APIs
2. On-device AI - local models are faster, cheaper
   - running local models is also more environmentally friendly
   - better for business
   - SLMs are more than suitable for specialized uses
3. Identify & authentication - delegation, permissions, security
4. Compensation - access fees, subscriptions, micropayments, ads
   - The protocol layer should have a method for payments built into it
   - RSL - [Really Simple Licensing](httsp://rslstandard.org)
5. Discovery and discernment
   - Recommendation engines, ranking, algorithms

## Building for Browserless Web
Model Context Protocol - MCP
- Set up resources as MCP servers, set up APIs for MCPs
- Provide /llms.txt files
- Accommodations for agents can also be helpful for people
- Wrangling non-human traffic
  - robots.txt - [block agents](https://bit.ly/block-ai-bots)
  - handling 'naughty' bots that ignore robots.txt. [Send them to the tar pits!](https://bit.ly/ai-tar-pits)

# Takeaway: What we build today sets the standard for tomorrow.
