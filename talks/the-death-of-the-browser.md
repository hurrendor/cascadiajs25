## Abstract: 

What is the Web without a browser? Through Chrome, Google has been supporting and stewarding the growth of the web as an ads-supported economy. Now, AI Agents and MCP threaten to change everything. Some might say the Web is about to die, but maybe it is about to be reborn like a phoenix.
