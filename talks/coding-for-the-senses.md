## Abstract: 

Explore how to code for sight, sound, touch, and more! Learn how creative frontend tools can turn websites into full-sensory experiences that feel as good as they function.
## Community talk notes:

## Nostalgia
- Why don't things come in fun colors anymore?
- Where did the custom ringtones go?
- Customization is embedded in our developer DNA
- But now (thanks to design systems) everything looks the same
- Boring :-(

## Engaging Our Senses in building web experiences
### From Pages to Places
- 2d is often inadequate (buying furniture)
- Web experiences need to keep up
- How to build immersive places instead of just pages?

### A Demo D&D App in the R3F Ecosystem
- React Three Fiber (for Three.js)
- React 3 Fiber works as any over React div
- Just give it props
- Already has helper library for defining 3d shapes
- Don't need to be an expert in 3D animation
- Complex animations are still possible with the React useFrame hook

### 3D Animation is Changing the Web Experience
- Animations like this are powering modern Ecommerce
- Online Learning
- Touring apartments/homes/hotels

### The Digital Handshake
- The next sense: touch
- Place Order experience is too unresponsive and can lead to lost sales
- Experience is inadequate, no proper handshake
- React and animation library both want to own the dom

### Creating Dice Animations with GSAP
- GSAP - GreenSockAnimation Platform
- Can animate anything the DOM can touch
- Gives direct access to change properties on existing animations/object
- GSAP React Library released this year with Custom React Hooks
- Smooth animations across the whole application make things more immersive

### Sound
- Silent pages/videos feel dead, no emotional investment
- Spooky music instantly add anxiety to a normal video
- Unsolicited sound is still a no-no, is not accessible

### Generative Audio - Tone.js
- Based on state/user interactions
- Randomizes music based on given params (happy/sad/spooky/day/night/etc)
- Most commonly seen in video games
- Makes it possible to create an unseen score

### Digital Terroir
- We can't smell the internet yet
- Scent very strongly tied to memory
- All of the sounds/sights together creates your Digital Terroir

### View Transitions API 
- Smooth transitions between light and dark mode
- Created with Tailwind and custom CSS properties
- Trigger: View Transitons API
- Using the snapshot method
- Possible to choreograph  full immersive transitions between modes

### Taste/Overall Theme
- We also cannot taste the internet
- Bringing it all together cohesively

## Coding for the senses
- Users are not just logical, they are emotional beings looking for clarity and connection
- On your next PR ask "How should this make the user feel?"
- But always remember accessibility
