## Abstract: 

A radical new take on how to architect large data applications entirely in JavaScript â€“ no python required. This talk covers how I built the open-source libraries Hyparquet and HighTable for loading Apache Parquet files client-side in the browser.
## Community talk notes: 

### Time to First Data
How fast can we go from opening a web page to seeing the data we're working with?

Goal: In a system's architecture, burn the backend, but keep the CDN/cloud front while increasing speed of access to data.

### How do we replace the backend?
Local-First Apps - frontend-only paradigms. (Not apps for offline work and then syncing up later.)

### Cloud-Native Formats
Cloud-Native GeoTiff (COG)
### Apache Parquet
Column oriented data storage format. Can be queried remotely and contains it's own index.

### How to make JS fast?
- Avoid round trips
- Avoid memory allocation
- Zero copy
- Typed arrays (Int32Array, etc)
- Web workers to offload computation tasks
- WASM for decompression

*Fun fact: If your WASM blob is < 4kb, it can be loaded synchronously
- no emscripten
- writing your own memcpy

### HighTable
- using HyParquet, reads the index and queries the parquet for only that data

### Up next..
Apache Iceberg uses parquet to build large-scale database systems on top of object storage.
