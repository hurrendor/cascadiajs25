# CascadiaJS 2025
In September of 2025, the world / Pacific Northwest converged for CascadiaJS 2025. Here are the community notes for conference talks.

## Getting started:
Talk notes are under `talks/`. Everything is in Markdown; no installation needed. 

## PR Guidelines:
Community pull requests are encouraged! If you're adding or updating notes, please handle merges with any existing notes.

## Helpful links:

### Further reading - I just want the structure:
OK, that's cool too ( but it'd be a lot cooler to add your takeaways to the community! )
If you'd like to change the schema for next year's talks, or create your own note templates, the notes skeletons are created from `utils/createNoteSkeletons.js` using NodeJS.

From the main directory..
- set up: `yarn install`
- create the note skeletons: `node createNoteSkeletons.js`
